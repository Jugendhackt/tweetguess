# Tweetguesser
The twitter guessing game
------------------------------------------------------------------
## Idea
A tweet and 4 popular twitterusers are shown of which only one posted it,
know you are to decide which one did.

## Score System
You have 30 seconds to guess who wrote the tweet. If your right, you get  one point for each second left on the counter.

## Intention
Playfully raise awareness about weird content posted all over socialmedia.

## Tech
The frontend is based on the Bootstrap and jQuery framework.
The most retweeted tweets of Users, chosen by us, are fetched by the Twitter-API every 15 min and loaded into a MongoDB.
From there, the frontend gets the tweet and according options.The answer is sent back and checked.
If the answer is right, ther timer is stopped and points credited.
